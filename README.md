# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component

![Design preview for the Results summary component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my first project with Frontend Mentor, where I have created a results summary component using Tailwind CSS.

In this challenge, the task was to build a results summary component that closely resembles the provided design. By leveraging the power of Tailwind CSS, I was able to efficiently style and structure the component, ensuring it closely matches the design specifications.

Tailwind CSS provided me with a comprehensive set of utility classes that made it easier to create responsive layouts, apply consistent styling. The utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS allowed me to rapidly iterate and fine-tune the component's appearance.

## The challenge

The challenge involved paying attention to detail and closely replicating the design, focusing on layout, typography, color scheme, and overall styling. By using Tailwind CSS, I was able to achieve pixel-perfect accuracy and create an intuitive and visually appealing results summary component.
